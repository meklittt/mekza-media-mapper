# Water in Egypt 🌊

**Water in Egypt** is an interactive Media Mapper developed by **Meklit Abebe**. The mapper geospatially ties connections between *Al-Kawākib* (illustrated magazine) archives and Egypt's central waterbodies: the Aswan Dam and the Suez Canal.

## Why Egypt? 💧

This project is entirely based on qualitative research conducted at the Library of Congress. The archival artifacts are sourced from the African and Middle Eastern Division’s collection of *Al-Kawākib*. Arabic text from these images may not be fully visible, but are translated into English. Aimed at expanding the field of "Blue Humanities," this map visually presents the interactions between state-controlled waterbodies, public perception, and media.

The framework was developed by Ben Tyler and [Lost Creek Designs](https://lostcreekdesigns.co/).
