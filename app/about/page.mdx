# Water in Egypt🌊

**Water in Egypt** is a Media Mapper developed by **Meklit Abebe** with the goal of drawing connections between Al-Kawākib (Egyptian Illustrated Magazine) and Egyptian waterbodies. In its current iteration, Water in Egypt contains the Aswan Dam, and the Suez canal, and other landmarks/waterbodies.

## Why Egypt? 💧

Great question! I conducted qualitative research as part of an association with the Library of Congress, where I gained access to a plethora of primary texts. All print media images are derived from exclusive artifacts housed in the African and Middle Eastern Division. Arabic text from the images may not be visible, but are translated into English—this is visible in the bios. 

I hope to enrich the area of "Blue Humanities" to include underrepresented regions, such as Egypt, through this Media Mapper.

# About the Media Mapper

## What is it?

The Media Mapper is an open source framework intended to be used as a starting point for building a web application geared towards exploring Media throughout time and space.

The project was dreamt up by **Ennuri Jo** as a way to explore the relationship between media and water. Funding for this project was provided by the [University of Pennsylvania, Penn](https://www.upenn.edu/). The framework was developed by Ben Tyler and [Lost Creek Designs](https://lostcreekdesigns.co/).

Please see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Aqueous-Earth-Catalog-Team/media-mapper) for more information about how you can get started with the project!
