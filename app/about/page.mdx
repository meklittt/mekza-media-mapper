# Water in Egypt 🌊

**Water in Egypt** is an interactive Media Mapper developed by **Meklit Abebe** with the goal of drawing connections between *Al-Kawākib* (illustrated magazine) media archives and Egyptian waterbodies: the Aswan Dam and the Suez Canal.

## Why Egypt? 💧

Great question! I conducted qualitative research as part of an association with the Library of Congress, where I gained access to a myriad of primary texts. All print media images are photocopies derived from *Al-Kawākib*, which is housed in the African and Middle Eastern Division. Arabic text from these images may not be fully visible, but are translated into English. I hope to expand the field of "Blue Humanities" to center underrepresented regions, such as Egypt, by examining the interactions between state-controlled waterbodies, public perception, and media.

# About the Media Mapper

## What is it?

The Media Mapper is an open source framework intended to be used as a starting point for building a web application geared towards exploring Media throughout time and space.

The project was dreamt up by **Ennuri Jo** as a way to explore the relationship between media and water. Funding for this project was provided by the [University of Pennsylvania, Penn](https://www.upenn.edu/). The framework was developed by Ben Tyler and [Lost Creek Designs](https://lostcreekdesigns.co/).

Please see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Aqueous-Earth-Catalog-Team/media-mapper) for more information about how you can get started with the project!
