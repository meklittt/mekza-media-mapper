# Media Mapper

An open-source framework for exploring media objects based on their geographical location data. Media Mapper provides a spatially driven way of exploring how topics (i.e. water, the environment, landmarks) are portrayed in media across space and time.

![Made possible through funding provided by the University of Pennsylvania](./public/upenn_logo.png)

## 🌍 Overview

Media Mapper is designed to be a flexible, open-source web application framework that allows anyone to build their own media exploration tool with geospatial data. The application connects to Airtable as a data source and provides an interactive map interface for browsing and exploring media content.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Map**: Browse media locations by zooming, panning, and selecting data points
- **Detailed Media Views**: View additional information about selected points including images and text
- **Shareable URLs**: Each map data point has a unique URL for easy sharing
- **Tabular View**: Browse the entire dataset in a structured table format
- **Accessibility**: Built to conform with WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards
- **Customizable**: Fork and customize for your own datasets

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm, pnpm, or yarn
- Airtable account with properly structured data

## 🗄️ Data Source Configuration

Media Mapper uses Airtable as its primary data source. Your Airtable base must follow a specific schema for the application to work correctly.

### Mapbox Account Setup

#### 1. Create a Mapbox Account

- Sign up for a free account at [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)
- Mapbox provides generous free usage limits (up to 50,000 map loads per month)

#### 2. Get Your Access Token

1. After signing up, navigate to your [Mapbox Account Dashboard](https://console.mapbox.com/account/access-tokens/)
2. Go to the **Access tokens** section
3. Copy your **Default public token** (starts with `pk.`)
4. Alternatively, create a new public token:
   - Click **Create a token**
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Media Mapper Production")
   - Select the **Public scopes** (the defaults are sufficient)
   - Click **Create token**

#### 3. Configure Token Restrictions (Optional but Recommended)

For production deployments, restrict your token usage:

1. Click on your token in the dashboard
2. Add **URL restrictions** to limit usage to your domains
3. Example restrictions:
   - `http://localhost:3000/*` (for local development)
   - `https://yourdomain.com/*` (for production)

#### 4. Add to Environment Variables

Add your Mapbox token to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.your_actual_token_here
```

**Important**: The token must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be available in the browser for map rendering.

### Required Airtable Setup

#### 1. API Access

- Create an Airtable account at [airtable.com](https://airtable.com)
- Generate a personal access token from your [Airtable account settings](https://airtable.com/account) with the scopes `data.records:read`
- Note your Base ID from your Airtable base URL - it will be the first path parameter (i.e. https://airtable.com/[BASE_ID]?)

#### 2. Base Structure

Your Airtable base should contain the following tables:

##### Media Locations Table

A table named **"Media Locations"** with the following fields:

##### Required Fields:

- **Name** (Single line text) - Primary field, name of the location/media
- **Latitude** (Number) - Geographic latitude coordinate
- **Longitude** (Number) - Geographic longitude coordinate

##### Optional Location Fields:

- **Location Name** (Single line text) - Descriptive name of the location
- **Natural Feature Name** (Single line text) - Name of natural features (rivers, mountains, etc.)
- **City** (Single line text) - City name
- **Region** (Single line text) - State/Province/Region
- **Country** (Single line text) - Country name

##### Linked Media Fields (from related Media table):

- **Name (from Media)** - Linked record field to Media table
- **Original Title (from Media)** - Lookup field
- **Director (from Media)** - Lookup field
- **Release Year (from Media)** - Lookup field
- **Description (from Media)** - Lookup field
- **Image (from Media)** - Lookup field (Attachment)
- **Video (from Media)** - Lookup field (Attachment)
- **Video Link (from Media)** - Lookup field (URL)
- **Subjects (from Media)** - Lookup field (Multiple select)
- **Language (from Media)** - Lookup field (Multiple select)
- **References (from Media)** - Lookup field (Long text)
- **Rights (from Media)** - Lookup field (Single line text)
- **Rights Statement Link (from Media)** - Lookup field (URL)
- **Media Type (from Media)** - Lookup field (Single select)

##### Web App Metadata Table

A table named **"Web App Metadata"** with the following fields to customize your site's metadata and branding:

**Required Fields:**
- **Site Title** (Single line text) - The title that appears in the browser tab and navigation
- **Site Description** (Long text) - Meta description for SEO and site previews
- **Site Keywords** (Multiple select or Single line text) - Keywords for SEO optimization
- **Creator** (Single line text) - Attribution information for site creators
- **Owner** (Single line text) - Organization or individual who owns/operates the site

**Usage:**
- The application reads the first record from this table to populate site metadata
- This data is used for:
  - Browser page titles and meta descriptions
  - Navigation bar title
  - Footer attribution
  - Social media preview information
  - Search engine optimization

**Example Record:**
```
Site Title: "Water Stories Map"
Site Description: "Explore how water is portrayed in media across different locations and time periods through our interactive mapping platform."
Site Keywords: ["water", "media", "geography", "storytelling", "environmental"]
Creator: "Dr. Jane Smith, University Research Team"
Owner: "Environmental Media Research Lab"
```

**Important Notes:**
- Only the first record in this table is used by the application
- If this table is missing or empty, the application falls back to default metadata
- Changes to this table require a new deployment to take effect in production

#### 3. Views and Permissions

- Create a view in your "Media Locations" table that includes all records you want to display
- Ensure your Airtable base is shared with appropriate permissions for your API key
- Set the view name in your `AIRTABLE_VIEW_NAME` environment variable

### Data Schema Types

The application expects the following TypeScript interfaces (defined in `lib/airtable/types.ts`):

```typescript
interface MediaLocation {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  longitude: number;
  latitude: number;
  location_name?: string;
  natural_feature_name?: string;
  city?: string;
  region?: string;
  country?: string;
  media?: Media;
}

interface Media {
  name: string;
